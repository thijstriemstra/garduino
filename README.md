Garduino
========

Arduino code for greenhouse monitoring using ESP32.

## Features

Controls 12V water valve and water pump and starts them once a day
to water the plants for a period of time. A water flow meter keeps
track of how much water is used.

Device status is displayed on a small 0.91 inch OLED screen.

Includes a manual mode button to enable/disable the water valve manually.

Time is stored in a battery-powered DS3231 realtime clock.

### Sensors

| Target | Sensor | Location | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Light | BH1750 | Inside | 1 |
| Soil moisture | Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v2.0 | Inside | 5 |
| Temperature/pressure/humidity | BME280 | Inside | 1 |
| Air temperature | DS18B20 | Outside | 1 |
| Water temperature | DS18B20 | Outside | 1 |
| Rain | YL-83 | Outside | 1 |

Readings from the sensors are sent to a MQTT server over WiFi (if available).

## Development

Checkout code and open the `garduino` project in VSCode with the PlatformIO
IDE extension.

## Local NTP Server

Setup a local NTP server instead of fetching this information online every
time.

```console
sudo apt-get install ntp
```

Verify installation:

```console
sntp --version
```

Switch the server pool to the ones closest to your location. Go to
https://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/NTPPoolServers and find the
nearest pool, e.g. Europe. Update `/etc/ntp.conf` accordingly:

```
	   server 0.europe.pool.ntp.org
	   server 1.europe.pool.ntp.org
	   server 2.europe.pool.ntp.org
	   server 3.europe.pool.ntp.org
```

Restart the server:

```console
sudo service ntp restart
```

Check the status:

```console
 sudo service ntp status
 ```

You can now use this machine for NTP time synchronization on the ESP32.
