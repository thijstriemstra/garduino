  a period of time
- Device status is displayed on a small 0.91 inch OLED screen
- Includes a manual mode button to enable/disable the water valve manually
- Time is stored in a battery-powered DS3231 realtime clock

## Local NTP Server

Setup a local NTP server instead of fetching this information online every
time.

```console
sudo apt-get install ntp
```

Verify installation:

```console
sntp --version
```

Switch the server pool to the ones closest to your location. Go to
https://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/NTPPoolServers and find the
nearest pool, e.g. Europe. Update `/etc/ntp.conf` accordingly:

```
	   server 0.europe.pool.ntp.org
	   server 1.europe.pool.ntp.org
	   server 2.europe.pool.ntp.org
	   server 3.europe.pool.ntp.org
```

Restart the server:

```console
sudo service ntp restart
```

Check the status:

```console
 sudo service ntp status
 ```

You can now use this machine for NTP time synchronization on the ESP32.
